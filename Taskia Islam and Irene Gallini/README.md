# Noise Effects on Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution

***Provide a description of your project including*** 

1. motivating your research question
2. stating your research question
3. explaining your method and implementation
4. Briefly mention and discuss your results
5. Draw your conclusions
6. State what future investigations 
7. State your references 

### Further Guidance: Formating
- Structure this readme using subsections
- Your job is to 
    - keep it clear
    - provide sufficient detail, so what you did is understandable to the reader. This way other researchers and future cohorts of BeyondQuantum will be able to build on your research
    - List all your references at the end
- utilise markdown like *italics*, **bold**, numbered and unnumbered lists to make your document easier to read
- if you refer to links use the respective markdown for links, e.g. `[ThinkingBeyond](https://thinkingbeyond.education/)`
- If you have graphs and pictures you want to embed in your file use `![name](your_graphic.png)`
- If you want to present your results in a table use
    | Header 1            | Header 2  |
    |---------------------|-----------|
    | Lorem Ipsum         | 12345     |

**Tip:** Use tools to create markdown tables. For example, Obsidian has a table plugin, that makes creating tables much easier than doing it by hand.

## Research Question

State your research question here and elaborate on it.

## Motivation

Explain your motivation for your chosen research question here.

## Your next subsection

Continue working through the points listed above with the help of sensibly named subsections.

## Future Work

State and explain what follow-up research could be conducted based on your work.

## References

List all your references here. Remember to put links into markdown. For example:

1.  Einstein, A. (1905). *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies*. Annalen der Physik, 17, 891-921. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/einstein-1905-relativity)

**Tip**: *If you have you references in BibTex, Google Scholar or Zotero*
1. Create/copy a list into ChatGPT
2. Ask it to turn it into an unsorted list in markdown
