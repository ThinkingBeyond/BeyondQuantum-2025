# Noise Effects on Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution

## Introduction
Have you ever wondered whether a credential information you send to another person actually remains secure between the two parties? Are there any potential ways you could determine whether some tried decrypting it? That’s where Quantum Cryptography comes to play! By encoding bits into polarized photon states, quantum cryptography utilizes quantum mechanical principles to ensure that your information remains secure. 

Our research focused on dividing deep into understanding a limitation of the quantum key distribution’s BB84 protocol: the impacts on the secure key by the vulnerable measurement device. We learned that one of the most effective ways to remove this limitation and make quantum cryptography more practical is by implementing the Measurement-Device-Independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD): in this protocol, the key never gets impacted by the measurement device. The bonus? The protocol may involve untrustable third parties. We implemented the protocol on Qiskit to visualize the way it works.

That’s not it- our research further dived deep into the noise effects compared to the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) on MDI-QKD compared to other QKD protocols to deduce conclusions as to the possible limitations of MDI-QKD. The reason for this is that we want to make sure that this protocol is completely applicable and the main concerns are considered. We simulated the BB84, B92 and E91 protocols on Qiskit, implemented noise effects and QBER for all three protocols as well as for the MDI-QKD protocol. Further research could be implemented on concluding the most effective methodology to improve the model discussed in our research.

## Research Question

Our research question had two main parts: the first one focuses on the MDI-QKD protocol and the second question considers the limitations. As mentioned previously, the purpose of having two parts was to make sure we not only explain how this particular protocol is promising but also look at it from a practical and applicable perspective.

Research question:
1. How can we remove the vulnerabilities of measurement devices in Quantum Key Distribution?
2. How are noise effects a limitation of removing these vulnerabilities?
