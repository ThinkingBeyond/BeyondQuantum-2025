# DECOHERENCE AND THE PREFERRED BASIS PROBLEM

## Motivation
The measurement problem is one of the biggest foundational issues in Quantum Mechanics. The question of how and when we transition from a quantum to a classical state following measurement has been present since Quantum Mechanics inception. The numerous attempts to solve this problem have led to many different schools of thought. One of the most popular of these
groups is the many worlds interpretation which is what we focused on in our project.
The preferred basis problem is present in many interpretations however is particularly apparent in the MWI. The question of why, during the branching, we split in the position basis or any particular
basis is vitally important for describing the reality we experience. Following this, we searched for potential solutions and found decoherence[^3] as a natural option. However, upon a literature review of this
we found disagreement. This led us to our research question.

## Research Question
### Does decoherence as a mechanism solve the preferred basis problem in the many worlds interpretation?
To research this question we selected two papers with opposing opinions on the subject. For our paper supporting decoherence we selected Wallaces paper[^1] because it was the general point of reference for people who viewed that the preferred basis problem was solved in the MWI. We selected Inamori's paper[^2] to represent the opposing view due to the strong claims and logical structure of the paper. We then compared them in a theoretical context pointing out flaws in the arguments and reasoning. To solidify our comparison we then applied the viewpoints to a concrete experimental context.

## Methodology
For the comparison we first started by listing the main arguments made each author. Once this was complete we applied their arguments to the following **critera**:
- The comparison must be done in the context of an interpretation/formalism that both the papers apply to. For this Everett's Relative State formalism [^4]was chosen because this is the formalism Wallace makes his arguments within and Inamori's paper claims that no quantum process can explain the existence of a preferred basis which would apply to processes within Everett's formalism. This provides a background to directly compare the papers.
- The arguments should be first assessed in isolation before they are fully contrasted and compared to one another. This is to highlight any initial inconsistencies in the arguments made by the authors.
- The arguments and viewpoints must also be applied to an experimental context. This is another way to directly compare the papers and what they say about reality. This is crucial for a conrete comparison and to clearly expose the flaws in the arguments.

## Conclusions
After our review we found that Wallace's argument relied on an unjustified assumption about the initial state of the system and used flawed reasoning in deducing the system environment split when applying
decoherence. This led us to conclude that, at least in the context of arguments given by the papers, that decoherence is not a solution to the preferred basis problem.

## Future Research
To add more depth to the project in the future, we would like to use more papers in our comparisons. This will allow for more perspectives and a more complete picture of the topic. We would also
potentially discuss other proposed solutions to the preferred basis problem and their strengths and weaknesses in relation to decoherence.
