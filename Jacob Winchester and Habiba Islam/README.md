# DECOHERENCE AND THE PREFERRED BASIS PROBLEM

## Motivation
The measurement problem is one of the biggest foundational issues in Quantum Mechanics. The question of how and when we transition from a quantum to a classical state in the presence
of a measurement has been present since Quantum Mechanics inception. The many attempts to solve this problem has led to many different schools of thought. One of the most popular of these
groups is the many worlds interpretation which is what we focused on in our project.
The preferred basis problem is present in many interpretations however is particularly apparent in the MWI. The question of why, during the branching, we split in the position basis or any particular
basis is vitally important for describing the reality we experience. Following this, we searched for potential solutions and found decoherence as a natural option. However, upon a literature review of this
we found disagreement leading us to our research question.

## Research Question
### Does decoherence as a mechanism solve the preferred basis problem in the many worlds interpretation?
To research this question we selected two papers with opposite opinions on the subject. We then compared them in a theoretical context pointing out flaws in the arguments and reasoning. To solidify our
comparison we then applied the comparisons to concrete experiments.

## Conclusions
After our review we found that the paper in favour of decoherence relied on unjustified assumptions about the system and used flawed reasoning in deducing the system environment split when applying
decoherence. This led to conclude that, at least in the context of arguments given by the papers, that decoherence is not a solution to the preferred basis problem.

## Future Research
To add more depth to the project in the future, we would like to use more papers in our comparisons. This will allow for more perspectives and a more complete picture of the topic. We would also
potentially discuss other proposed solutions to the preferred basis problem and their strengths and weaknesses in relation to decoherence.

### Further Guidance: Formating
- Structure this readme using subsections
- Your job is to 
    - keep it clear
    - provide sufficient detail, so what you did is understandable to the reader. This way other researchers and future cohorts of BeyondQuantum will be able to build on your research
    - List all your references at the end
- utilise markdown like *italics*, **bold**, numbered and unnumbered lists to make your document easier to read
- if you refer to links use the respective markdown for links, e.g. `[ThinkingBeyond](https://thinkingbeyond.education/)`
- If you have graphs and pictures you want to embed in your file use `![name](your_graphic.png)`
- If you want to present your results in a table use
    | Header 1            | Header 2  |
    |---------------------|-----------|
    | Lorem Ipsum         | 12345     |

**Tip:** Use tools to create markdown tables. For example, Obsidian has a table plugin, that makes creating tables much easier than doing it by hand.
