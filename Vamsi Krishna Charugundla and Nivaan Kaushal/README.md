# Leveraging Quantum Entanglement for Fluid Dynamics Simulations



## MOTIVATION
We aimed to explore whether quantum computing—especially the use of quantum entanglement and superposition—could provide a scalable alternative. By encoding fluid properties into quantum states and constructing a lattice grid through qubit interactions, we hypothesized that quantum simulations could reproduce realistic flow patterns with fewer computational resources.where this motivated us by the increasing computational cost and complexity of classical fluid dynamics simulations, particularly when modeling flow around obstacles or within irregular geometries. Traditional methods require solving complex partial differential equations and often become inefficient as spatial resolution increases.
***Provide a description of your project including*** 
1. motivating your research question
2. stating your research question
3. explaining your method and implementation
4. Briefly mention and discuss your results
5. Draw your conclusions
6. State what future investigations 
7. State your references 

### Further Guidance: Formating
- Structure this readme using subsections
- Your job is to 
    - keep it clear
    - provide sufficient detail, so what you did is understandable to the reader. This way other researchers and future cohorts of BeyondQuantum will be able to build on your research
    - List all your references at the end
- utilise markdown like *italics*, **bold**, numbered and unnumbered lists to make your document easier to read
- if you refer to links use the respective markdown for links, e.g. `[ThinkingBeyond](https://thinkingbeyond.education/)`
- If you have graphs and pictures you want to embed in your file use `![name](your_graphic.png)`
- If you want to present your results in a table use
    | Header 1            | Header 2  |
    |---------------------|-----------|
    | Lorem Ipsum         | 12345     |

**Tip:** Use tools to create markdown tables. For example, Obsidian has a table plugin, that makes creating tables much easier than doing it by hand.

## Future Work

State and explain what follow-up research could be conducted based on your work.

## References

List all your references here. Remember to put links into markdown. For example:

1.  Einstein, A. (1905). *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies*. Annalen der Physik, 17, 891-921. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/einstein-1905-relativity)

**Tip**: *If you have you references in BibTex, Google Scholar or Zotero*
1. Create/copy a list into ChatGPT
2. Ask it to turn it into an unsorted list in markdown
